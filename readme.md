# Exploration of time usage and distance travelled of FordGoBikes
## by (Prateek Rana)


## Dataset

> The data consisted of the 192082 times the bikes have been issued by the Ford Go Bikes company in January, 2019. There are 14 columns out of which the numerical variable is the duration column containing the number of seconds the bike was issued for.


## Summary of Findings

> In conclusion I found that in the dataset of FordGoBikes for the month of January, 2019, the average distance travelled by the ussers was approximately 1.5 km. Most of the users took less amount of time on the bikes. There were outliers in both numerical values. The expected result of subscribers using the service of FordGoBikes was true.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The correlation between both the numerical variables namely duration_sec and distance is 0.139, implying that there is a very weak relation between the two variables. However when I plotted a scatter matrix, we could see that there is a positive relationship between the two. In the diagnol of the scatter matrix we can see that most bikes take less duration of time and for the distance variable we can see that mostly users travel for 1.5 km, however there are users who go for more too.

> Expected results were found when I plotted the violin plots grid. We could see that the subscribers are the users between both the type of users who use the bikes more. Even though, as we can interpret, that there are many outliers in the subscriber duration graph, in the customer duration graph, there are more users that use the bike for more time than the subscribers. But with immense number of outliers we can conclude that the subscribers use the bikes more.

> The distance is more or less the same between the two groups, most of the users travel approximately 1.5 kilometers.
